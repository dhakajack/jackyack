I wanted to embed a CW keyer into another project, but didn't want to work it up from scratch. Luckily, I found the <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/yack/'>YACK</a> project by  Jan Lategahn. His v0.7 code worked right off, but I wanted to tweak the defaults for my own purposes and to put the code under version control for future work. In addition to code, I've put an Eagle schematic and picture of the schematic in the repository.  See the <a href='https://code.google.com/p/jackyack/wiki/Commands'>command quick reference</a> for functions.

Here are the compiled hex and eep files, targeted to the ATtiny45:
