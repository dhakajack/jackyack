Released: V. 0.3 16.12.2010

 + Allow speed change anytime
 + Add a paddle swap function
 + Fix slight difference between keying and playback
 + Callsign training sometimes creates funny callsigns
 + Callsign training sometimes does not want my V!
 + TX INV mode needs to be initialized properly after reset
 + Add a function that inhibits keying in command mode
 + Add a callsign training function
 + Decoder does not understand /?<SK> Might need that for macros
 + Find a better way to handle command mode.
 + LFSR should not be called from yack code
 + Add a MACRO function.. Entry through command mode, Left and right paddle
 + Save all settings in EEPROM
 + Integrate dk3lj.h macro into this file
 + Exit even during a char
 + Add a Beacon function
 + Change DIT and DAH for speed up and down
 + Change default timeout to 5 seconds
 + Should streamline constant naming "DIT" & "DAH"
 + Cleanded up and rearranged code
 + Added functions to toggle INV, TX and sidetone bits
 + Moved the latches into volatile flag register
 + Callsigns are repeating :-)
 
 
Released: V. 0.4 05.06.2011
 
  + Let the chip go to power off mode after 30 seconds of inactivity (can be revived
    with Dit, Dah or Command key) Power consumption is so low that no power switch is needed
  + Default TXINV mode is now clear after reset. This caters for keyers driven through a NPN transistor.
 

Released: V. 0.5
  + Added Ultimatic and DAHPRIO modes
  + Modified the keying logic as timing appeared wrong
  + Added a Lockdown mode to prevent unwanted changes
  + Added functionality to prevent chip power down when beacon function is active
  + Extended tune mode keydown to 20 seconds
  + Extended pause after R in callsign practise mode
  + Added Farnsworth function
  + Pause after command keypress??
  + Speed not identical in keyer and playback
  
  
Released: V. 0.6
  + Small bug in V-Command, sounds error after Version number
  + Changed entire timing logic to be based on timer 1
  + Doubled system heartbeat to 5ms and removed all corrections now
    playback and iambic keying sound exactly the same
  + Farnsworth pause was not stored
  + Reintroduced inactivity timeout from command mode
  
Released: V. 0.7
  + Bug in the Macro playback routine. After playing back, the routine
    immediately sends an OK and exits to key mode. Now it does not send the OK but returns to 
    key mode after 15 seconds so the user gets the chance to repeat the macro in this time.

Released V. 0.75 (really, just personalized preferences for DK3LJ's YACK project) 03.10.2013
  + Default mode Iambic A
  + Default side tone 700 Hz
  + Default keying positive
  + Default speed 15 wpm
  + Plays greeting "73" (without keying) when powered on
  + Replaced "OK" with "R" for command acknowledgments
  + Replaced "E" with "SK" when exiting command mode
